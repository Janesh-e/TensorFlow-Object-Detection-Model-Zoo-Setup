## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- OS: Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 (Tested)
- RAM: 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended)
- Disk Space: At least 5‚Äì10 GB free
- GPU (Optional but recommended): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

## üîß Tools Required

| Tool                   | Version / Note                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Python                 | 3.8 or 3.9 (tested: 3.9.x)              |
| TensorFlow             | 2.10.1                                  |

### ‚úÖ Recommended Way to Clone and Set Up

You **can clone it anywhere**, but for **cleanliness and easier navigation**, it‚Äôs recommended to:

- Create a dedicated project folder.
- Clone the repo inside it.
- Set up your Conda environment from that folder.

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup (for Python 3.10 Conda environment)

#### **üêç Step 1: Create and Activate Conda Environment**

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts:

```powershell
conda create -n tfmodels python=3.9
conda activate tfmodels
```

---

#### **Step 2: Install TensorFlow (with GPU if desired)**

```powershell
pip install tensorflow==2.10.1  # or any compatible version for 3.10
```

---

#### **üì¶ Step 3: Clone the Repo into a Folder**

```bash
mkdir tf_projects
cd tf_projects
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
cd models/research
```

This repository contains the official **TensorFlow Object Detection API** codebase, including pre-trained models and config files.
